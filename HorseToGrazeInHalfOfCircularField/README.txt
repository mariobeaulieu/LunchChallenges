This project is to solve the problem of a horse attached to the fence
of a circular field. You want the horse to graze over exactly half
of the area of the field.

The solution of that problem is iterative.
The length of the rope cannot be isolated from the equation describing
the problem because it involves finding an angle and the equation has
that angle embedded in sin, cos, and as a value. Therefore, the way to
find the solution is iterative.

I have included an Excel spreadsheet that evaluates the equation for
many angles and the solution is when that equation fits best the
equality. The spreadsheet also draws the solution.

There is also a Python app that calculates the solution iteratively
using the equation and its derivative.
