This is just a test to compare 2 algorithms to rotate arrays.
The array is generated to be a range of numbers from 0 to N.
The program asks for the size of the array and the number of positions to rotate.
It then prints the result based on 2 algorithms:
1) rotate(rotate(r:),rotate(:r))
2) Intuitive algorithm by replacing value at index r by value at index 0, ...
